# about this project
This is just a small modification of SPQR.TextAudioTool v0.4 that allows, in addition to the original functionality, to get the emotion (sentiment) of the message and send it to the client.
Edit the TextAudioToolPref.json (it will be created after the first run of the script) file to select a sentiment classification model and enable/disable sentiment classification and audio.
The audio can be sent to its desination using a virtal adudio cable.
